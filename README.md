# Recipe Finder

## Overview

The objective of this app is to showcase my [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) skills. This project is based on [my submission]((http://recipefinder90.herokuapp.com) to the [final assignment](ASSIGNMENT_FOR_MODULE_3_README.md) for the course [Ruby on Rails: An Introduction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ruby-on-rails-intro), which I believe is way too simple to showcase the professional skills required by the industry.

You may [demo the app](http://recipefinder91.herokuapp.com), which has been deployed to [Heroku](www.heroku.com).
